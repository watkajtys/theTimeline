# Human History Timeline

This project is a frontend web application that visualizes the entire history of humanity on a proportional, interactive timeline. The goal is to create a compelling visual representation of the accelerating pace of human progress, from the Big Bang to the present day.

## Features

*   **Proportional Timeline:** Each historical era is rendered with a width proportional to its duration, visually emphasizing the vastness of early history.
*   **Interactive Events:** Key historical events are marked on the timeline. Users can click on these markers to view more details in a pop-up window.
*   **Automatic Zoom:** The timeline automatically zooms in on the most recent eras as you scroll to them, allowing for a clearer view of the dense, modern part of history.
*   **Minimalist Design:** The application is designed with a clean, minimal aesthetic to focus attention on the data and the visualization itself.

## How to View

This is a static web project. To view the timeline, simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. No web server is required.

## TODO List / Proposed Enhancements for Next Session

Here are some ideas for future enhancements to the project:

*   **[ ] Improved Zoom Functionality:** Refine the zoom feature to be more proportional. Instead of just expanding the recent eras, we could implement a "smooth zoom" that dynamically recalculates the widths of all eras as you scroll, providing a more fluid and intuitive experience.
*   **[ ] Logarithmic Scale Toggle:** Add a control to allow users to switch between the current linear scale and a logarithmic scale. This would provide an alternative way to explore the dense parts of the timeline.
*   **[ ] Filter by Era:** Implement a filtering mechanism (e.g., a dropdown menu or buttons) to allow users to show or hide specific eras, enabling them to focus on periods of interest.
*   **[ ] Enhanced Pop-ups:** The pop-up cards for events could be enhanced to include images, short videos, or links to external resources like Wikipedia for more in-depth information.
*   **[ ] Keyboard Navigation:** Add support for keyboard navigation, allowing users to scroll through the timeline using the left and right arrow keys.
*   **[ ] Advanced Responsive Design:** Further optimize the layout and interactivity for a seamless experience on mobile and tablet devices.
*   **[ ] Search Functionality:** Add a search bar to allow users to quickly find specific events on the timeline.
